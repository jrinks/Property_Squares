This program takes in property info and determines if the property will be a good investment.  The program starts by instantiating a class Property which contains a dictionary which will bes used to store all user input and calculated values.  Next, there are several class methods, some take user input, some do calculations, some do both. Finally, there is a driver function which starts by giving the user a welcome message, instantiating the class, then calling each function in order.
